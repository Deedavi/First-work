<h2 id="">Classification of Computer</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal computer:</strong> A small, single-user computer based on a microprocessor.</li>
<li><strong>Workstation:</strong>A powerful, single-user computer. A workstation is like a personal computer, but it has a more powerful microprocessor and, in general, a higher-quality monitor.</li>

<li><strong>Minicomputer:</strong> A multi-user computer capable of supporting up to hundreds of users simultaneously.</li>
<Li><strong>Mainframe:</strong> A powerful multi-user computer capable of supporting many hundreds or thousands of users simultaneously.</Li>
<Li><strong>Supercomputer:</strong>An extremely fast computer that can perform hundreds of millions of instructions per second.</Li>
