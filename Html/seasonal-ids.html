    <h1>All About Dogs</h1>
    <P id="all-about-dogs">The dog is a <em>pet animal.</em> <br> A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily,<br> it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, and a nose. <br> It is a very<strong> clever animal</strong>  and is very useful in <strong>catching thieves.</strong> <br> It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers. <br> </P>

    <h2>They are happy Animals</h2>
    <p id="they-are-always-happy">A happy dog's whole body can wag along with their tail. <br> A wriggling dog showing you their belly is likely to be a very happy and comfortable dog. <br> Each dog breed has a different relaxed tail position, <br>but a happy dog will generally raise it slightly. <br></p>
