    <h1>LIFE</h1>
    <p>Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems <br>
        Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams, <br>
        Or carnival of careless joys that leap <br>
        About your hearts like billows on the deep <br>
        In flames of amber and of amethyst. <br>
        Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist <br>
        Till some resistless hour shall rise and move <br>
        Your hearts to wake and hunger after love, <br>
        And thirst with passionate longing for the things <br>
        That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings. <br></p>
        <div id="h2">Life is worth living</div>
        <h2>Life is Beautiful</h2>
    
</body>
